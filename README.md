The idea of an 6-digit Nixie-like clock, using eight 1.69" 280x240 ST7789 IPS LCDs.
It should display the time as hh:mm:ss (eight displays)

Not yet shure if i that idea may work at all..

Components, which may change:
* Arduino Nano ESP32 (Nora)
* RTC DS3231SN
* 8x 1.69" 280x240 ST7789 IPS LCD
* (what else..?)
